# TechHappy's SPTarkov Web Minimap Mod

This mod creates a web accessable map to view your current location and look direction in order to help you navigate throughout Escape From Tarkov. I made this mod to help myself and a family member learn where the caches and extracts are.

This mod was heavily inspired by [CactusPie's Minimap](https://github.com/CactusPie/SPT-Minimap). Without it, this mod wouldn't exist. Especially because I didn't know the polynomial math that was required.

# Current Status

### Maps:
- [ ] Factory
- [x] Woods
- [x] Customs
- [x] Interchange
- [x] Reserve
- [x] Shoreline
- [ ] The Lab
- [x] Lighthouse
- [x] Streets

### Features:
- [x] Follow player button
- [x] In-game config of port and update frequency
- [x] Enhanced Interchange map 
- [ ] Show connect URL in in-game config section

### Goals:
Add toggle layers for loot and other important locations
Possible Lab map but I think it would need loot and key layers before release

### Notes:
This is my first SPTarkov mod and it is very messy. I will clean up the code in the near future but I am currently focusing on how it functions before I worry about maintenance. Silly of me but that is how I work.
